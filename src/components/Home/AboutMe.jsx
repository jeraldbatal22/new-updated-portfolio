              {/* <p>Hello, my name is Jerald. You can call me JB, Jer, or Rald. I am 4 years graduated in Bachelor of Science degree in Hotel and Restaurant Management. I recently made a career shift into the field of software engineering to further develop my coding skills and knowledge. I discovered a passion for building and publishing websites along the way. My career goal is to become a highly skilled and professional web developer, with aspirations of becoming a full-stack developer in the future. In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball, mobile games, and computer games. I also find relaxation in playing the guitar instrumentally and arranging music. Additionally, I like to watch K-Dramas and Netflix movies when I feel stuck or bored with coding.</p> */}
